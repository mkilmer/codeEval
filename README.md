# Code Evaluation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

I chose Angular because it has a very fast and efficient way of two way binding, so updating the array happens in real time. And also because it was a good opportunity to learn a new technology in a closer to real world scenario.

Anytime the app is updated, it prints out the users array in the console. All relevant files can be found in /src folder. With the majority of the files in the /app folder. Feel free to email me at mrmikekilmer@gmail.com with any questions.

If you want to run this on a local server, move the contents of the /dist folder to a server root. Or set up a proper local development environment using the technique detailed here: [https://angular.io/guide/quickstart](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart)
